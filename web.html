    <h3>C++ is an extension of the C programming language that includes object-oriented programming (OOP) features, among other enhancements. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ builds on C's capabilities while adding support for classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts. It's widely used for system/software development, game development, and performance-critical applications.</h3>

    <h3>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java applications can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), and large-scale enterprise systems.</h3>
